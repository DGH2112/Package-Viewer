## Overview

This is a RAD Studio wizard / expert / plug-in which allows you to browse all the loaded packages in the RAD Studio IDE and examine their details including list the components that are contained within a package.

## Use

Package viewer can be accessed from the main IDE Help menu (since Delphi 10.0 Seattle there is a "Help Wizards" sub-menu)

The viewer displays all the packages loaded into the IDE in a treeview where the branches of a package show information about the packages and the components within those packages.

## Miscellaneous

You can install [Delphinus package manager](https://github.com/Memnarch/Delphinus/wiki/Installing-Delphinus) and then install Package Viewer there. (Delphinus-Support)
