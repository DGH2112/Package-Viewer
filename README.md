## Overview

This is a RAD Studio wizard / expert / plug-in which allows you to browse all the loaded packages in the RAD Studio IDE and examine their details including list the components that are contained within a package.

## Use

The viewer displays all the packages loaded into the IDE in a treeview where the branches of a package show information about the packages and the components within those packages.

## Miscellaneous
